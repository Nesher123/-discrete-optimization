### TO DO:

- Close all running tasks on computer and try finding solutions with less colors and automatically using different
  solvers.
- Apply the greedy approach (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_coloring) after getting a good-enough feasible
  solution from the solvers.<br>
  This will improve the results and the final grade, as discussed in the
  forums (https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization/discussions/weeks/3/threads/3rUx-bHfEeiINRIP7RuXjA)
